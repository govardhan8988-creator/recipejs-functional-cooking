🍳 RecipeJS – Functional Cooking Companion

A modern, beginner-friendly recipe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on functional programming concepts and clean code practices.

This project is developed step-by-step across multiple lessons, with each part building on the previous one.

📌 Project Overview

RecipeJS dynamically renders recipe cards from JavaScript data and provides a clean, responsive user interface.

Current Features (Part 1)

Semantic HTML structure

Modern CSS styling with Flexbox

Dynamic recipe card rendering

Difficulty badges (Easy / Medium / Hard)

Hover effects and responsive layout

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Semantic structure

CSS3 – Flexbox, gradients, hover effects

JavaScript (ES6) – Arrow functions, map(), template literals

Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration
